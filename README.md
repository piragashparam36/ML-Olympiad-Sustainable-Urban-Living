# ML-Olympiad---Sustainable-Urban-Living

Overview
Finding a suitable place to live is a crucial decision, significantly impacting your well-being. While online listings provide information, it can be challenging to assess a property's true "habitability" based solely on descriptions. This is where AI can lend a helping hand!

This competition invites you to leverage Machine Learning techniques to develop a model that predicts the habitability score of a property based on available details. Your model will contribute to a user-friendly system that empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their living spaces. #MLOlympiad
